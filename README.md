## About

I build end-to-end analytics products that turn fragmented, messy data into systems people can actually use to make decisions.

My work sits at the intersection of **data engineering, analytics, and product design**—from modeling clean SQL schemas and defining reliable KPIs, to building interactive dashboards and thoughtfully designed data experiences. I care just as much about *how the data is structured* as *how it’s communicated*.

I’m especially interested in domains where data meets real-world behavior:
- **Sports analytics** (NBA performance, efficiency, and trends)
- **Live events & entertainment analytics** (revenue, customers, operations)
- **Business intelligence** that leadership teams can trust at a glance
